Observations ----
- Next.js stores backend server routes in an API folder.
These routes can be accessed from the clientside with fetch calls.
- Components default to server components, but can be client components. Any component that uses a react hook / state should be client components.
- NextAuth uses sessions

GOOGLE AUTH TUT ----

2. Create New Project "promptopia"

4. Credentials > Create OAuth client ID
5. Get Client ID + Client Secret > Paste in .env

Questions:
-  server compoennts should be used when fetching data, but client components should be used when using state and hooks. Most of my components that fetch data also use state and hooks- so what should I do?
- Have i been msking my react components wrong? Should I instead use plain variables and not useState?
